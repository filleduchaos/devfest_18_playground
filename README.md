# DevFest '18 Playground

This repo contains the code from my live-coding session at DevFest Lagos 2018 (on the basics of
animation with Flutter and embedding Flutter widgets in Android apps).

The `flutter_animation_basics` folder is a Flutter module containing a series of examples that 
demonstrate various animation concepts and a widget that transitions between images with a Venetian
blinds-like animated effect. `app` contains a regular Android app that employs that widget to cycle
through the last ten images on a user's device.

## You will need:

- Android Studio (or at least the SDK, if you're comfortable using it from the command line)
- The Flutter SDK (you can grab that [here](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install))
